# jupyterhub-the-hard-way

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

Understanding JupyterHub by deploying it step by step.

## Motivation

We want to help you build understanding of JupyterHub and its core components: proxy, authenticator, spawner.
This tutorial goes through a series of labs to progressively customize JupyterHub beyond its defaults. The
configurability of JupyterHub enables its use in a variety of deployment settings. This benefits our users, but
also makes it difficult to recommend a one-size-fits-all deployment. By helping you understand how
JupyterHub works, we hope you will be able to confidently customize JupyterHub to suit your deployment needs.
